# A simple Todo List 

The list contains simple todo items with a few properties:

- Importance  (1 - 5)
- Description
- Completed / Done

### Sort   
The list can be sorted by 4 buttons (drop down list in mobile view).  
ðŸ‘‰ Press button twice to toggle sort order

| Sort                    | initial sort order            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ``By Name``             | ascending (A...Z)             |
| ``By Due Date``         | ascending (oldest first)      |
| ``By Creation Date``    | ascending (oldest first)      |
| ``By Importance``       | descending (highest first)    |

### Filter:  
Press ``Filter Open`` to show only open items. ðŸ‘‰ Press again to show all.

### Theme:
A ``light`` and a ``dark`` theme are available, which can be toggled via the ``Toggle Theme`` button.  
The selection is stored in the browser's localStorage and will be applied on next use.

### Add / Edit Form  
- Press ``New Task`` to add a new item to the list.
- Click the ``Edit`` button of an item in the list to edit it.  

For new items the due date will be set to the current day, importance to 3.
